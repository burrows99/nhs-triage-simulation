doctor avg wait 9.9 min is low (threshold: 12.0 min)
mri avg wait 0.0 min is low (threshold: 24.0 min)
mri underutilized at 2.4%
ultrasound avg wait 1.3 min is low (threshold: 16.0 min)
ultrasound underutilized at 27.3%
bed avg wait 28.5 min is low (threshold: 48.0 min)
bed heavily utilized at 95.8%
Urgent MRI cases: 2 total patients needed urgent MRI and bed
Out of 2, 1 bypassed doctor and went directly to MRI (50.0% bypass rate)
Model accuracy (mock eval): Simulated 50.0% (set factor: 80.0%), difference: 0.300
Mock eval details: 2 urgent cases evaluated, 1 correctly bypassed doctor
Mock evaluation: Assessed routing accuracy for urgent MRI cases using simulation outcomes as proxy for Synthea synthetic data and LLM responses. Ground truth: bypass doctor for urgent cases.
