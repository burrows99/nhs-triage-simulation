--- COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT ROUTING ANALYSIS ---
üö® URGENT MRI CASES ANALYSIS:
  Total Urgent Cases: 110 patients (red triage + MRI needed)
  Direct MRI Routing: 86 patients bypassed doctor (78.2% bypass rate)
  Doctor-First Routing: 24 patients went to doctor first (21.8%)
  üìä GOOD URGENT ROUTING: Moderate bypass rate with room for improvement

üìã COMPREHENSIVE ROUTING PATHWAY ANALYSIS:
  Total Patients Processed: 2040

  üè• ROUTING PATHWAYS BREAKDOWN:
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor-Only Path: 1527 patients (74.9%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ No imaging required, direct to bed after doctor consultation
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí MRI ‚Üí Bed: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard MRI pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Ultrasound ‚Üí Bed: 427 patients (20.9%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard ultrasound pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Both Imaging ‚Üí Bed: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Complex cases requiring both MRI and ultrasound
    ‚Ä¢ Direct MRI Access: 86 patients (4.2%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Bypassed doctor consultation for urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ Direct Ultrasound Access: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Direct ultrasound routing (if implemented)

  üö® TRIAGE DISTRIBUTION:
    ‚Ä¢ Red (Critical): 218 patients (10.7%)
    ‚Ä¢ Orange (Urgent): 306 patients (15.0%)
    ‚Ä¢ Yellow (Less Urgent): 479 patients (23.5%)
    ‚Ä¢ Green (Non-Urgent): 541 patients (26.5%)
    ‚Ä¢ Blue (Lowest Priority): 496 patients (24.3%)

  üî¨ IMAGING REQUIREMENTS:
    ‚Ä¢ MRI Required: 110 patients (5.4%)
    ‚Ä¢ Ultrasound Required: 444 patients (21.8%)
    ‚Ä¢ Both Imaging Required: 22 patients (1.1%)
    ‚Ä¢ No Imaging Required: 1508 patients (73.9%)

  üìä ROUTING EFFICIENCY INSIGHTS:
    üìù Direct ultrasound routing not implemented - all ultrasound via doctor
    ‚úÖ Efficient doctor-only pathway for 1527 patients requiring no imaging
    üîÑ Complex cases: 22 patients required multiple imaging modalities

  üí° PATHWAY OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Consider implementing direct ultrasound routing for appropriate cases
    ‚Ä¢ Evaluate opportunities for more direct MRI access beyond urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ High proportion of doctor-only cases - ensure adequate doctor capacity
    ‚Ä¢ Optimize scheduling for patients requiring multiple imaging studies

--- MODEL ACCURACY EVALUATION ---
Routing Accuracy Assessment:
  Simulated Accuracy: 78.2%
  Expected Accuracy: 80.0%
  Accuracy Difference: 0.018 (2.3% deviation)
  Sample Size: 110 urgent cases evaluated
  Correct Decisions: 86 out of 110 cases
‚úÖ EXCELLENT MODEL PERFORMANCE: Accuracy very close to expected

Technical Note: Comprehensive evaluation: Assessed routing patterns across all patient pathways including urgent MRI routing, direct imaging access, doctor-only pathways, and triage-based routing efficiency. Ground truth: bypass doctor for urgent cases, optimize pathways based on patient needs.
