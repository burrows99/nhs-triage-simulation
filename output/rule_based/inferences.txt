--- COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT ROUTING ANALYSIS ---
üö® URGENT MRI CASES ANALYSIS:
  Total Urgent Cases: 120 patients (red triage + MRI needed)
  Direct MRI Routing: 0 patients bypassed doctor (0.0% bypass rate)
  Doctor-First Routing: 120 patients went to doctor first (100.0%)
  ‚ùå POOR URGENT ROUTING: Very low bypass rate significantly delays critical care

üìã COMPREHENSIVE ROUTING PATHWAY ANALYSIS:
  Total Patients Processed: 2092

  üè• ROUTING PATHWAYS BREAKDOWN:
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor-Only Path: 1551 patients (74.1%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ No imaging required, direct to bed after doctor consultation
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí MRI ‚Üí Bed: 99 patients (4.7%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard MRI pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Ultrasound ‚Üí Bed: 421 patients (20.1%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard ultrasound pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Both Imaging ‚Üí Bed: 21 patients (1.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Complex cases requiring both MRI and ultrasound
    ‚Ä¢ Direct MRI Access: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Bypassed doctor consultation for urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ Direct Ultrasound Access: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Direct ultrasound routing (if implemented)

  üö® TRIAGE DISTRIBUTION:
    ‚Ä¢ Red (Critical): 230 patients (11.0%)
    ‚Ä¢ Orange (Urgent): 314 patients (15.0%)
    ‚Ä¢ Yellow (Less Urgent): 520 patients (24.9%)
    ‚Ä¢ Green (Non-Urgent): 493 patients (23.6%)
    ‚Ä¢ Blue (Lowest Priority): 535 patients (25.6%)

  üî¨ IMAGING REQUIREMENTS:
    ‚Ä¢ MRI Required: 120 patients (5.7%)
    ‚Ä¢ Ultrasound Required: 442 patients (21.1%)
    ‚Ä¢ Both Imaging Required: 21 patients (1.0%)
    ‚Ä¢ No Imaging Required: 1551 patients (74.1%)

  üìä ROUTING EFFICIENCY INSIGHTS:
    üìù Direct ultrasound routing not implemented - all ultrasound via doctor
    ‚úÖ Efficient doctor-only pathway for 1551 patients requiring no imaging
    üîÑ Complex cases: 21 patients required multiple imaging modalities

  üí° PATHWAY OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Consider implementing direct ultrasound routing for appropriate cases
    ‚Ä¢ Evaluate opportunities for more direct MRI access beyond urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ High proportion of doctor-only cases - ensure adequate doctor capacity
    ‚Ä¢ Optimize scheduling for patients requiring multiple imaging studies

--- MODEL ACCURACY EVALUATION ---
Routing Accuracy Assessment:
  Simulated Accuracy: 0.0%
  Expected Accuracy: 0.0%
  Accuracy Difference: 0.000

‚úÖ EXCELLENT MODEL PERFORMANCE: Accuracy very close to expected

Technical Note: Comprehensive evaluation: Assessed routing patterns across all patient pathways including urgent MRI routing, direct imaging access, doctor-only pathways, and triage-based routing efficiency. Ground truth: bypass doctor for urgent cases, optimize pathways based on patient needs.
