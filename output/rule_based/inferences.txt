doctor avg wait 3.4 min is low (threshold: 12.0 min)
mri avg wait 0.0 min is low (threshold: 24.0 min)
mri underutilized at 21.5%
ultrasound underutilized at 35.7%
bed avg wait 4.2 min is low (threshold: 48.0 min)
bed heavily utilized at 90.4%
Urgent MRI cases: 4 total patients needed urgent MRI and bed
Out of 4, 0 bypassed doctor and went directly to MRI (0.0% bypass rate)
Model accuracy (mock eval): Simulated 0.0% (set factor: 0.0%), difference: 0.000
Mock eval details: 4 urgent cases evaluated, 0 correctly bypassed doctor
Mock evaluation: Assessed routing accuracy for urgent MRI cases using simulation outcomes as proxy for Synthea synthetic data and LLM responses. Ground truth: bypass doctor for urgent cases.
