--- COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT ROUTING ANALYSIS ---
üö® URGENT MRI CASES ANALYSIS:
  Total Urgent Cases: 99 patients (red triage + MRI needed)
  Direct MRI Routing: 71 patients bypassed doctor (71.7% bypass rate)
  Doctor-First Routing: 28 patients went to doctor first (28.3%)
  üìä GOOD URGENT ROUTING: Moderate bypass rate with room for improvement

üìã COMPREHENSIVE ROUTING PATHWAY ANALYSIS:
  Total Patients Processed: 2097

  üè• ROUTING PATHWAYS BREAKDOWN:
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor-Only Path: 1660 patients (79.2%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ No imaging required, direct to bed after doctor consultation
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí MRI ‚Üí Bed: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard MRI pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Ultrasound ‚Üí Bed: 366 patients (17.5%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Standard ultrasound pathway through doctor first
    ‚Ä¢ Doctor ‚Üí Both Imaging ‚Üí Bed: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Complex cases requiring both MRI and ultrasound
    ‚Ä¢ Direct MRI Access: 71 patients (3.4%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Bypassed doctor consultation for urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ Direct Ultrasound Access: 0 patients (0.0%)
      ‚îî‚îÄ Direct ultrasound routing (if implemented)

    ‚Ä¢ Orange (Urgent): 299 patients (14.3%)
    ‚Ä¢ Yellow (Less Urgent): 520 patients (24.8%)
    ‚Ä¢ Green (Non-Urgent): 497 patients (23.7%)
    ‚Ä¢ Blue (Lowest Priority): 584 patients (27.8%)

    ‚Ä¢ Both Imaging Required: 20 patients (1.0%)
    ‚Ä¢ No Imaging Required: 1635 patients (78.0%)

  üìä ROUTING EFFICIENCY INSIGHTS:
    üìù Direct ultrasound routing not implemented - all ultrasound via doctor
    ‚úÖ Efficient doctor-only pathway for 1660 patients requiring no imaging
    üîÑ Complex cases: 20 patients required multiple imaging modalities

  üí° PATHWAY OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
    ‚Ä¢ Consider implementing direct ultrasound routing for appropriate cases
    ‚Ä¢ Evaluate opportunities for more direct MRI access beyond urgent cases
    ‚Ä¢ High proportion of doctor-only cases - ensure adequate doctor capacity
    ‚Ä¢ Optimize scheduling for patients requiring multiple imaging studies
