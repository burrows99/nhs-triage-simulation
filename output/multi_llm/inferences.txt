Urgent MRI cases: 2 total patients needed urgent MRI and bed
Out of 2, 2 bypassed doctor and went directly to MRI (100.0% bypass rate)
Model accuracy (mock eval): Simulated 100.0% (set factor: 70.0%), difference: 0.300
Mock eval details: 2 urgent cases evaluated, 2 correctly bypassed doctor
Mock evaluation: Assessed routing accuracy for urgent MRI cases using simulation outcomes as proxy for Synthea synthetic data and LLM responses. Ground truth: bypass doctor for urgent cases.
