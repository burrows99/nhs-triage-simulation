This package contains the core triage processing components that follow SOLID principles.
Each class is now in its own dedicated file for better maintainability.

All components implement the paper's objective triage system requirements:
- Single responsibility for specific processing tasks
- Open/closed principle for extensible processing strategies
- Dependency inversion with configurable components
